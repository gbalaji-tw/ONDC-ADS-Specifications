## Ads on Network

ONDC is attempting to allow sellers of products and services to buy a space for advertisements to ensure discoverability of the product and direct it to the right audience. Since discoverability can be attained through both online and offline channels, the concept covers advertisements within the ONDC network as well as off-ONDC transactions.
